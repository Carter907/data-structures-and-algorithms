So, which is better: Selection Sort or Insertion Sort? The answer is: well, it depends. In an average case—where an array is
randomly sorted—they perform similarly. If you have reason to assume you’ll be dealing with data that is mostly sorted, Insertion Sort will be a
better choice. If you have reason to assume you’ll be dealing with data that is mostly sorted in reverse 
order, Selection Sort will be faster. If you have no idea what the data will be like, that’s essentially an average case, and both will be equal.
